# fireworks-graphics
In this repo I want to refactor one of my oldest scripts - simple fireworks GUI based on the turtle library.

# how to launch
from root directory use the terminal command:
```
python fireworks/main.py
```
You can use flags for to indicate the sparks range, it's: "-s" or "--sparks-amount-range"
and numbers in format "20-30"
